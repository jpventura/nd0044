# Full Stack Web Developer
The goal of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills they need to build database-backed APIs and web applications. A graduate of this program will be able to design and build databases for software applications, create and deploy database-backed web APIs, and secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend. Students will also learn how to deploy a Flask-based web application to the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes.

## SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
Master relational databases with the power of SQL, and leverage Python to incorporate database logic into your programs.

## API Development and Documentation
Learn how to use APIs to control and manage web applications, including best practices for API testing and documentation.

## Identity Access Management
Implement authentication and authorization in Flask and understand how to design against key security principle. You will also gain experience with role-based control design patterns, securing a REST API, and applying software system risk and compliance principles.

## Server Deployment and Containerization
Develop an understanding of containerized environments, use Docker to share and store containers, and deploy a Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster using AWS
